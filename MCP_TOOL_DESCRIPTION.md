# Android-Connect MCP Tool - AI Assistant Guide

## For AI Assistants Using This Tool

This document provides comprehensive instructions for AI assistants to effectively use the Android-Connect MCP server. Read this carefully to understand all available capabilities and how to use them.

## System Overview

**Android-Connect** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI agents with tools to manage Android-based logistics and paperwork automation. The system:

1. **Connects** to Android devices running the BCA Track app
2. **Pulls** vehicle transport load data from the Android app's SQL database
3. **Generates** professional loadsheets and timesheets in PDF format
4. **Manages** delivery dates, timesheet entries, and vehicle information
5. **Provides** download links for all generated paperwork

## Core Concepts

### Loads
- **Load Number**: Unique identifier (e.g., `$S275052`)
- **Collection Points**: Where vehicles are picked up
- **Delivery Points**: Where vehicles are delivered
- **Vehicles**: List of vehicles on each load (registration, make/model, color)
- **Dates**: Delivery dates (can be overridden for grouping)

### Paperwork Organization
- Files are organized by week ending (Sunday)
- Folder format: `DD-MM-YY` (e.g., `27-10-25` for October 27, 2025)
- Each load gets both `.xlsx` and `.pdf` files
- PDFs are automatically generated from Excel files

### Timesheets
- Organized by week ending date
- Track daily hours: start time, finish time, total hours
- Support for driver and fleet registration information

- **Timesheet Data**: Structured weekly timesheet information

## Integration

This MCP server can be integrated with:
- **n8n** - Workflow automation platform
- **Claude Desktop** - AI assistant with MCP support
- **Any MCP-compatible client** - Via HTTP/SSE or stdio transport

## Technical Details

- **Transport**: HTTP/SSE (Server-Sent Events) for web clients, stdio for desktop
- **Default Port**: 8100
- **API Backend**: Flask server on port 5020
- **Authentication**: Configurable (currently supports Bearer and Header auth)

## AI Assistant Best Practices

### 1. Always Provide Download Links
When generating paperwork, ALWAYS extract and present the PDF download URL to the user.

‚ùå **Bad:** "Loadsheet generated successfully"  
‚úÖ **Good:** "Loadsheet generated successfully! Download your PDF here: http://10.10.254.10:5020/api/paperwork/download/$S275052_WBAC_Ashford.pdf"

### 2. Check Data Freshness
Before searching for "today" or "this week" loads, consider checking database age:
```
If user asks about recent/current loads:
  1. Check database_freshness
  2. If > 1 hour old, suggest pulling latest data
  3. Then search loads
```

### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully
- If load not found: Suggest checking load number or pulling latest data
- If device offline: Provide device status and troubleshooting steps
- If file not found: Use list_paperwork_weeks to show what's available

### 4. Be Proactive with Related Information
When showing load details, mention:
- Vehicle count
- Key locations
- Date
- Whether paperwork exists (check with get_paperwork_files)

### 5. Understand User Intent
- "Show loads" = search and display
- "Generate paperwork" = create PDF + provide download link
- "Get files" = list existing files with download links
- "Check device" = device status

### 6. Use Tool Combinations
**Example - Complete paperwork workflow:**
```
1. search_loads_by_date (find loads)
2. generate_loadsheet for each load
3. get_paperwork_files (confirm all PDFs created)
4. Present all download links to user
```

### 7. Natural Language Date Handling
Support flexible date expressions:
- "today" ‚Üí search_loads_by_date with "today"
- "this week" ‚Üí "this_week"
- "last Monday" ‚Üí calculate date, use specific date
- "next week" ‚Üí "next_week"

### 8. Timesheet Time Formats
Accept flexible time inputs:
- "7am" ‚Üí "07:00"
- "7" ‚Üí "07:00" (assume morning)
- "19" or "7pm" ‚Üí "19:00"
- "5:30pm" ‚Üí "17:30"

## Example Complete Workflows

### Workflow 1: Daily Paperwork Generation
```
User: "Generate all paperwork for today"

AI Steps:
1. search_loads_by_date({"period": "today"})
2. For each load found:
   - generate_loadsheet({"load_number": "{load}"})
   - Extract PDF URL from response
3. Compile all PDF URLs
4. Present to user:
   "Generated 5 loadsheets for today:
    - $S275052: [PDF URL]
    - $S275053: [PDF URL]
    ..."
```

### Workflow 2: Weekly Paperwork Review
```
User: "Show me all files from last week"

AI Steps:
1. Calculate last week's Sunday (week ending)
2. list_paperwork_weeks() to verify week exists
3. get_paperwork_files({"week_ending": "DD-MM-YY"})
4. Present organized list:
   "Last week (20-10-25) has 18 files:
    
    PDFs (15):
    - [filename]: [URL]
    ...
    
    Images (3):
    - [filename]: [URL]"
```

### Workflow 3: Timesheet Entry
```
User: "Add my hours for Monday to Friday, 7am to 5pm each day"

AI Steps:
1. For each day (Monday-Friday):
   - create_timesheet_entry({
       "day_name": "{day}",
       "start_time": "07:00",
       "finish_time": "17:00"
     })
2. Confirm all entries created
3. get_timesheet_entries({"week_ending": "{this week}"})
4. Show summary of week's hours
```

### Workflow 4: Load Investigation
```
User: "Tell me everything about load $S275052"

AI Steps:
1. get_load_details({"load_number": "$S275052"})
2. Check for existing paperwork:
   - list_paperwork_weeks()
   - get_paperwork_files() for relevant week
3. Check for date override:
   - get_load_date_override({"load_number": "$S275052"})
4. Present comprehensive information:
   - Collection/delivery points
   - All vehicles
   - Date info (including any overrides)
   - Existing paperwork with download links
```

## Error Handling Guide

### "Database not found"
‚Üí Use `pull_latest_data` to sync from device

### "Load not found"
‚Üí Suggest `pull_latest_data` or verify load number

### "Device offline"
‚Üí Use `get_device_status` and provide troubleshooting

### "Folder not found" (in get_paperwork_files)
‚Üí Use `list_paperwork_weeks` to show available weeks

### "No loads found for period"
‚Üí Suggest different date range or `pull_latest_data`

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

1. **PDF URLs are for downloading** - Present them as clickable links when possible
2. **Folder names use DD-MM-YY format** - Convert from YYYY-MM-DD if needed
3. **Load numbers start with $** - Don't forget the dollar sign (e.g., `$S275052`)
4. **Week ending is always Sunday** - Used for folder/timesheet organization
5. **PDFs are auto-generated** - No separate PDF generation tool needed
6. **Multiple tools can be used together** - Chain tools for complex requests
7. **Time format flexibility** - System handles various time input formats
8. **Date overrides affect paperwork grouping** - Check for overrides when dates seem wrong
