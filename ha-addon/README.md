- `POST /api/macros/{id}/execute` - Execute a macro

Full API documentation available in the web interface.

## Data Storage

All persistent data is stored in `/data`:

- `/data/sql.db` - Synced database file
- `/data/logs/` - Application logs
- `/data/apk/` - APK files for installation
- `/data/screenshots/` - Device screenshots
- `/data/paperwork/` - Generated documents
- `/data/screen_control.db` - Screen templates and macros

## Troubleshooting

### Devices Won't Connect

- Ensure ADB debugging is enabled on the device
- Check network connectivity between Home Assistant and devices
- Verify the correct IP address and port
- Try connecting manually: `adb connect IP:PORT`

### App Installation Fails

- Check that APK file exists in `/data/apk/BCAApp.apk`
- Verify sufficient storage on the device
- Ensure "Install from unknown sources" is enabled

### Database Pull Fails

- Device must be rooted for database access
- App must be stopped before pulling database
- Check ADB root permissions

### Ingress Not Working
